    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Kerlarity Kharkongor and I am currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Applications at Assam Don Bosco University, where I’m diving deep into the world of tech — from coding and software development to exploring how technology shapes the world around us. Outside of class, I work as a news anchor at a local channel in Shillong. It’s a role that’s taught me a lot about thinking on my feet, speaking with confidence, and connecting with people — skills I find surprisingly valuable even in tech.

      I am especially interested in web development, user experience design, and how we can build tech that's both functional and meaningful. I love getting hands-on with projects, whether it's designing a clean, responsive website or experimenting with a new JavaScript framework. I'm always curious, always learning, and excited about the endless possibilities this field offers. In the long run, I hope to blend my creativity, communication skills, and technical knowledge to build digital experiences that really make a difference.</p>
